# Parrot Card Game ðŸ¦œ

A fun memory game with cards based on parrot gifs, ideal for spending free time

## Features

- Randomly assemble the board based on the number of cards entered by the user. This number must be even and be between 4 and 14.

- When you click on the first card of the pair, it turns and shows the parrot behind

- By clicking on the second card:
    - If it completes the pair, it stays flipped until the end of the game. 
    - If not, the cards are flipped for 1 second and then return to the initial state.

- After finding all the pairs, the game is over and shows how many moves you made and how long, in seconds, it took to finish.

- The player can choose whether to play again:
    - If yes the user must input another valid number of cards. 
    - If not, nothing happens.
